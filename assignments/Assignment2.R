## Assignment 2: SPL Data & DPLYR
## Please write your code/responses in the places marked "Your code/response here"

## This assignment draws on Seattle Public Library circulation data from 2018-2023. The data only includes items that were checked out at least 15 times in a month.

## To explore the circulation data for yourself, see https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data

# Name: Kate Skow

## 1. Load the Seattle Public Library circulation dataset from the URL below and save it to a variable called `spl_df` (2 points)
# https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/raw/main/SPL-Checkouts-2018-2023-atleast15checkouts.csv
# Make sure you use the special argument that ensures text columns will be interpreted correctly!
spl_df <- read.csv("https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/raw/main/SPL-Checkouts-2018-2023-atleast15checkouts.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## 2. Load the DPLYR library (1 point)
library(dplyr)

## 3. How many rows are in this dataset?
# Use a built-in R function to find the number of rows and save to the variable `num_rows` (1 point)
num_rows <- nrow(spl_df)

## 2. How many columns are in this dataset?
# Use a built-in R function to find the number of columns and save to the variable `num_cols` (1 point)
num_cols <- ncol(spl_df)

## 3. There are more than just books in this dataset. Use a DPLYR function to identify all of the different, or "distinct," material types
# Save these values to the variable `material_types` (2 points)
material_types <- spl_df %>% 
                  distinct(MaterialType)

## Here's a motivating question to guide the next part of the assignment: How do the total number of checkouts for each material type compare — i.e., number of books checked out vs e-books vs audiobooks, etc.?

# We can answer this question in a few different ways. Let's first try to filter the dataframe.

# 4. Filter the dataframe for only print books and save the books dataframe to the variable `books_df` (2 points)
books_df <- spl_df %>% 
            filter(MaterialType == "BOOK")

## 5. Now use a DPLYR function to calculate the sum total number of checkouts for books from 2018-2023.
# Save this number to the variable `num_books` (2 points)
# (Your result may be a dataframe, and that's fine)
num_books <- books_df %>% 
             summarize(sum(Checkouts))

# A more efficient way to calculate the number of checkouts for each material type might be to group the material types together and then do a calculation on each group.

# 6. Use a DPLYR function to group by material type, and then calculate the sum total checkouts for each material type.
# Save to a variable `checkouts_per_material_type` (6 points)
checkouts_per_material_type <- spl_df %>%
                               group_by(MaterialType) %>% 
                               summarize(sum(Checkouts))

# View the `checkouts_per_material_type` dataframe and inspect the results

# 7. Make a built-in comment below, and answer the following questions in a few sentences:
# Which material type has the most number of checkouts, and does it surprise you or not?
# What other patterns or observations stand out to you or are interesting to you from the `checkouts_per_material_type` dataframe? (4 points)
  
  ##  E-books have the most number of checkouts, but not by much; physical books are not far
  ##  behind, which I would have expected to have the most, just because I assumed the library
  ##  would have the most books of anything. But now thinking about it, I imagine e-books are
  ##  checked out en masse/much more on a whim by a person, plus I know that e-books are often
  ##  returned automatically, thus making them available for the next checkout much quicker than
  ##  physical (and potentially late) returns. Amused and a bit unsure by the types "Unspecified"
  ##  and "Visual" - I wonder if their full catalog entries have a note somewhere with more
  ##  information about their formats.

# 8. How do the total number of checkouts from the SPL fluctuate over time? 
# Use a DPLYR function to group by year, and then calculate the sum total checkouts for each year
# Save to a variable `checkouts_per_year` (6 points)
checkouts_per_year <- spl_df %>% 
                      group_by(CheckoutYear) %>% 
                      summarize(sum(Checkouts))

# For fun, you can plot these results:
plot(checkouts_per_year, type = 'b')

# How do the total number of checkouts from the SPL fluctuate over time for a specific title or author?

# 9. First, filter the spl_df for a specific title or author of your choice. To do this filtering, you will probably need to use str_detect() from the stringr library.
# Save the filtered dataframe to the variable `query_df` (4 points)
library(stringr)
query_df <- spl_df %>% 
            filter(str_detect(Creator, "Gillian.*Flynn|Flynn.*Gillian"))

# 10. Now use a DPLYR function to group by year for that particular author or title, and then calculate the sum total checkouts for each year for that author or title
# Save to a variable `query_checkouts_per_year` (6 points)
query_checkouts_per_year <- query_df %>% 
                            group_by(CheckoutYear) %>% 
                            summarize(sum(Checkouts))

# For fun, you can plot these results:
plot(query_checkouts_per_year, type = 'b')

# 11. Lastly, come up with your own question that you want to answer about the SPL data, and then answer it by writing the appropriate code. You should use at least one DPLYR function. (3 points)

  ## For the book The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, which format has been the most popular at SPL?
gwtdt_checkouts <- spl_df %>% 
                   filter(str_detect(Title, "(?i)girl with the dragon tattoo")) %>% 
                   group_by(MaterialType) %>%
                   summarize(sum(Checkouts))
